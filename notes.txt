Network parameters
-------------------

grid_size: 500, 1000
The grid number G also has a subtle effect on interpretability. When G is too small, because
each one of activation function is not very expressive, the network tends to use the ensembling
strategy, making interpretation harder
G is the number of grid intervals

spline_order = usually 3

hidden neurons increase -> accuracy increase?
